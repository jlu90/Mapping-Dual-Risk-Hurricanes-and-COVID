# Project 5 - Identifying the Risk of COVID-19 and North Atlantic Hurricanes
Authors: Jocelyn Lutes, Quinton Lopez, Uriel Eckmann

## Problem Statement
---
The east coast endures more storms yearly than any other area of the country. The warm temperatures of the Atlantic increase the power of hurricanes. That combined with the common patterns of winds moving east to west after being formed in the eastern Atlantic make threats to residents homes, businesses, and way of life every hurricane season. From June 1st to November 30, citizens must remain aware of hazardous weather conditions except this year, an unexpected global pandemic could cause even more worry. The number of confirmed cases have passed 5 million and deaths have reached over 160,000 in the United States. There is no vaccine created and the close proximity of large groups of people significantly increases the chances of becoming infected. Identifying the areas at risk for Covid-19 and other natural disasters can help provide proper guidance for evacuating families and prevent the further spread of Covid-19.
